# Changelog

## Unreleased

Breaking changes to `omni_extract_bench.benchmark`. `score`, `predict` and the command line are
unchanged unless a line below says otherwise.

- `Run` is a NamedTuple, `Run(provider, options, out)`: an address of a run's folder. It has no
  `label`; a run's name is `run.out.name`.
- `Run`'s methods are functions over it: `run.needs(doc)` is `needs(run, doc)`,
  `run.store(doc, result)` is `record(run, doc.doc_id, result)`, `run.score(docs, ...)` is
  `grade(run, docs, ...)`, and `run.outstanding(docs)` is `owed(run, docs)`. New:
  `recorded(run, doc_id)` reads a record, and `prepare(run, corpus, timeout)` makes the folder
  and writes settings.json.
- `needs_run(path)` is gone; use `needs(run, doc)` or `recorded(run, doc_id)`.
- A failed call writes no prediction. `predict`'s `record["result"]` is `None` when
  `record["error"]` is set, and predictions/ holds only answers; the error is in records/.
  Grading reads a failure from the record. A run folder from before still grades the same,
  because its records already carry the error. A folder of your own predictions that marks a
  failure with `{"__error__": ...}` should leave that file out instead: a missing prediction is
  graded as failed.
